# rest-auth-files

A robust REST API for authentication and file management with JWT, refresh tokens, and multi-device session support.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Express.js** ‚Äî REST API framework
- **JWT** ‚Äî Authentication and session management
- **Multer** ‚Äî File uploads
- **Drizzle ORM** ‚Äî Type-safe database access
- **MySQL** ‚Äî Relational database
- **Docker** ‚Äî Containerization and orchestration

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Clone the repo:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/maxfromit/rest-auth-files.git
   cd rest-auth-files
   ```

2. **Copy environment variables:**

   ```bash
   cp .env\ example .env
   ```

   Edit `.env` as needed.

3. **Start the stack:**

## üîí Token & Session Logic

- **JWT (access token):** Short-lived, stateless, used for authentication.
- **Refresh token:** Long-lived, stored in DB with a unique `session_id` per device/session.
- **Multi-device:** Each login gets a new `session_id` and refresh token. Logging out on one device does **not** affect others.
- **Logout:**
  - `POST /logout` revokes the refresh token for the current session (`session_id` from JWT).
  - After logout, both the refresh token and access token for that session are blocked.
  - Access token is checked on every request; if its session is revoked, access is denied.
- **Token revocation:**
  - On logout, the DB field `revoked_at` is set for the session.
  - Middleware checks `session_id` on every request for instant revocation.

## üìù Notes

- The `id` field is used for both phone and email for simplicity. In a real-world app, these would be separate fields.

---

## üóÑÔ∏è File Storage

- Uploaded files are stored in a Docker-managed volume (`uploads`).
- The upload directory inside the container is `/app/uploads`.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Development & Maintenance

- To remove all data (including DB tables and uploaded files), run:
  ```bash
  docker-compose down -v
  ```

---

## üìö Useful Commands

- Start: `docker-compose up --build`
- Stop: `docker-compose down`
- Remove all data: `docker-compose down -v`
